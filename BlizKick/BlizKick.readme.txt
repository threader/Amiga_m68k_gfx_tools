Uploader: sintonen@iki.fi (Harry "Piru" Sintonen)
Type:     util/boot
Requires: OS 1.2+, phase5/DCE turbo with MAPROM feature or CPU Card
Version:  1.24
Replaces: util/boot/BlizKick.lha

BlizKick is used to rekick any Kickstart ROM image with Blizzard turbo
boards having MAPROM feature (jumper). Also A4000 CPU & Cyberstorm Cards
should work. BlizKick has been tested with BLIZZARD 1230-I, 1230-II,
1230-III, 1230-IV, 1240-T/ERC, 1260, 2040-ERC, 2060, Cyberstorm MK I,
Cyberstorm MK II, Cyberstorm MK III, CyberStorm PPC, Blizzard PPC and
A3640 boards. Kickstart 1.2, 1.3, 2.04, 2.05, 3.0 and 3.1 are currently
tested ROM images.

 BlizKick main features include:

- Speed up system operation noticeably!
- Allow you to upgrade the Kickstart ROM. Allow you to use AmigaOS 3.5
  and 3.9 with machine that has pre-3.1 ROM on chip. HOWEVER, PLEASE, DO
  NOT PIRATE THE KICKSTART ROM!
- Reduce the number of reboots needed on system cold boot. PrepareEmul,
  RsrvCold, SoftSCSI, BPPCFix and AmigaOS 3.5/3.9 SetPatch extra reboot
  can be removed!
- Allow you to downgrade the Kickstart ROM to play old games!
- Can patch the Kickstart ROM with external modules, comes with dozens
  of plug'n'play modules, speeding up and improving system operation,
  fixing Kickstart ROM bugs and so on!
- Full source code is included, in case you feel like hacking. :-)

  it didn't work on 68040 systems with p5/dce 68040.library (report by
  Marcin Kurek).

         V1.24rc4:

- Added new tool for MMU writeprotecting EXTRESBUF: protectextresbuf.
  It work with both p5/dce 680x0.library and mmu.library. (kindly
  betatested by KennyR, Cap`n^HIT, jPV and Hercules).
  WARNING! Read the documentation about protectextresbuf before use!
- Updated BlizKick EXTRES buffer API (bkapi.lha).
- Updated loadresident to use the new EXTRES buffer API.
- Fixed SpeedyIDE module to work with OS3.9BB2 scsi.device (several
  reports, special thanks to Joru for betatesting).

         V1.24rc3:

- Fixed V45 exec.library of AmigaOS 3.9 BoingBag2. It use quite crude
  hack to enable it, you'd better have true 32bit memory that doesn't go
  away at reset for this to work. Works on my BlizzPPC, Wizor's & SMF^'s
  Blizzard 1260, Cyber2th's CSMkII and Zerohero's Blizzard 2060 at
  least. YMMV. Note that this hack automagically fix some buggy programs
  that peek $f80000 for version information. Thanks to my impatient
  betatesters: Wizor, Jagge, Cyber2th, Zerohero, SMF^ and Lizard.
  Special thanks to Lizard for bugging me about this. Also thanks to
  everyone who mailed me about the problem.
- Improved romfixes module: No longer fail whole module if some
  sub-patch fail. Now it should be possible to use romfixes as the last
  module.

         V1.24rc2:

- Updated romupdatesplit to handle OS 3.9 BoingBag2. It kind of worked
  before too, but named some modules unknown.

- Modified files since 1.24rc1:
    BlizKick.readme
    BlizKick/romupdatesplit
    BlizKick/romupdatesplit.e

         V1.24rc1:

- Now set destination function code (dfc) for pflusha on 68040 and
  68060. It could fix some systems where dfc is not 1 or 2 by default
  and that have some magic supervisor mmu mapping.
- Unless something critical show up, this could become the final
  BlizKick 1.24 release.

- Modified files since 1.24beta8:
    BlizKick.readme
    BlizKick/BlizKick
    BlizKick/BlizKick.ASM
    BlizKick/BlizKick.guide

         V1.24beta8:

- Fixed silly bug from mmu.library support, now BlizKick try to use
  mmu.library if SetPatch is run *and* mmu.library is loaded in memory.
- Fixed a silly bug: If initializing MAPROM failed, BlizKick crashed
  horribly (could only happen with Blizzard 2040-ETC and 2060 cards
  MAPROM disabled).
- Added KEEPEXEC option to reboot without killing exec.library. Read
  the documentation before using!
- Fixed PowerUP card (CyberStorm PPC (and MK III), and Blizzard PPC)
  reboot code to kill exec.library, like with other cards. This fix
  some weirdo crashes from some reset proof applications that don't
  like ROM version changing on them.
- Fixed the infamous "RED screen crash at cold start" problem with
  some PowerUP cards by adding NOPUPREBOOT option.
- Improved romfixes module: Added graphics/InitArea() patch.
- Added new module: MuMove4K prepares system memory for MuFastZero's
  FastExec option. Substitutes MuMove4K by Thomas Richter.

  (several reports)

    BlizKick/BlizKick
    BlizKick/BlizKick.ASM

         V1.24beta6:

- Fixed a deadly bug from FixGetMsg module. (Marcin Kurek)
- Added EXTRESBUF support for CPU Cards. (^Berserk^)
- Now MODULE's default directory default to "DEVS:Modules/" directory if
  BKMODPATH env variable cannot be found. (Lizard) Added IGNPATH=
  IGNOREBKMODPATH/S option to ignore the directory change completely.
- Changed applypatch program to default BKMODPATH like BlizKick main
  program.
- Fixed RebootFix module to work with exec44. (several reports)
- Reworked some internal BlizKick routines, hopefully B20x0's work better
  now. Lets hope I didn't break anything. :) (vege)
- Fixed romfixes module: It no longer fail if put after OS3.5/3.9
  console.device module (several reports).
- Updated "romupdatesplit" and "AmigaOS 3.5/3.9 single boot system"
  guide chapters. (Téfal)

         V1.24beta5:

- Stripped this massive readme to only include changes since latest
  Aminet release. Now has a real 'main features' chapter.
- BlizKick work just fine with AmigaOS 3.9, modified the guide
  accordingly.
- Improved hackdisk module: Made it possible to patch the
  trackdisk.device that is inside extresbuf.
- Improved NoClick module: Changed the patching method to work with all
  V37+ ROM versions. Made it possible to patch the trackdisk.device that
  is inside extresbuf.
- Improved FixMath404 module: Made it possible to patch the
  mathieeesingbas.library that is inside extresbuf. Made the module
  recognize the A3000 mathieeesingbas.library that has only FPU
  routines, and thus doesn't have the bug. (Max)
- Improved romfixes module: Added patch for 68000/68010 utility.library
  UMult64() bug.

         V1.24beta3:

- Fixed very long-standing and stupid bug in BlizKick that affected CLI
  it was run from (BlizKick used to do Forbid() before terminating, very
  bad idea for a CLI program). Probably solves lots of problems that I
  haven't been able to identify before (for example, this bug caused
  CLI's TC_EXCEPTCODE to work very unreliably).
- I broke CPU Card support in 1.22beta8 when I added 256K ROM support:
  I wrote 'move.l' when I should have written 'cmp.l'. Again this makes
  me think asm coding is something really stupid. Now A3640 and friends
  should work again, I hope.
- Modified files since 1.24beta2:

    BlizKick/BlizKick
    BlizKick/BlizKick.ASM
    BlizKick/BlizKick.guide

         V1.24beta2:

- Improved romfixes module: Added patches for exec FreePooled(),
  graphics WriteChunkyPixels(), WritePixelArray8() and
  WritePixelLine8() bugs.
- Included new KingCON-handler.pch from new RemAPollo, maybe it works
  with OS 3.5 now?
- Fixed SPEEDROM from BlizKick and applypatch, it used to make the last
  romtag's RT_EndSkip point at $fffffe, and due to a bug in ROM (as a
  side-effect it made longword read access from that address) this made
  the hw buserror machines barf. Fixed it to point at $fffffa. Special
  thanks to Gunther Nikl for help.

         V1.24beta1:

- Fixed SaveROM to work with broken DMA SCSI device drivers and MMU
  mapped ROM.
- Total rewrite of BlizKick 68040 and 68060 cache & MMU routines.
  *Much* better now.
- Improved AlertFix module: Fixed to work with 68040 (Henes). Added
  NewAlert module support to AlertFix, ie. now it makes regular
  Alerts call NewAlert too. Found two bugs from OS Alert code, now
  has fix for these. Fixed silly bug that has been there from v1.0
  of the module, it never got the task pointer right (on BPPC). No
  longer requires 68040+ CPU, work 68020+.
- Improved romfixes module: Added patch for the alert bug (yes, only
  one of the two new bugs can be fixed by romfixes module).
- Improved NewAlert module: It is now MMU aware where needed. Made
  it play well together with AlertFix module.
