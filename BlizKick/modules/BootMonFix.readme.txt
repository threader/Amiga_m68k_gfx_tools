Type:         util/boot
Version:      1.0
Architecture: m68k-amigaos >= 1.2.0
Distribution: Aminet

This module disables the BlizzardPPC/CSPPC "BootVGA.Monitor" resident,
which is located in the accelerator's flash ROM and loaded during
startup.

The BootVGA resident is responsible for the "31KHz boot monitor" 
feature of CyberStorm and Blizzard boards with CyberVisionPPC, BVision
and G-Rex graphics cards. It also does some patching to copy Intuition
screens into the gfxcard framebuffer UNTIL CyberGraphX is loaded.

This could be undesirable if you have a second monitor, monitor switch
or flickerfixer as it will hugely slow down non-CGX Intuition screens
until CGX has loaded. It gets annoying if you boot from floppy as much
as I do. :)

This module simply disables it in the same way as Harry's BPPCFix040
module does. Tested with AlgorKick on an Algor PRO with Voodoo3/G-Rex,
Amiga 4000D.

Thanks to Piru (Harry) for giving me the OK on releasing this! :)
